============================

void DrawTexturePro(Texture2D texture, Rectangle source, Rectangle dest, Vector2 origin, float rotation, Color tint)
Draw a part of a texture defined by a rectangle with 'pro' parameters
ex: in Tick function of BaseSpace.cpp
    Rectangle source{mFrameX * mWidth+mOffsetX, mFrameY*mHeight, mWidth, mHeight};
    Rectangle dest{mScreenPos.x, mScreenPos.y, mScale*mWidth, mScale*mHeight};
    DrawTexturePro(mImage, source, dest, mOrigin, mfRotation, WHITE);
Draw an mImage(texture data). with source is a rectangle we get from texture data, and write it to dest. origin is the original point that we will use to rotate the image
normally, origin(0,0) that to the top left point of destination.
We can see source with mFrameX is the Frame number in X; mFrameY is frameNumber in y
we have mScale that allow us to scale that Frame in destination rectangle
