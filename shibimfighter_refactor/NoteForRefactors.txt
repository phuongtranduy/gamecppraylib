============================

void DrawTexturePro(Texture2D texture, Rectangle source, Rectangle dest, Vector2 origin, float rotation, Color tint)
Draw a part of a texture defined by a rectangle with 'pro' parameters
ex: in Tick function of BaseSpace.cpp
    Rectangle source{mFrameX * mWidth+mOffsetX, mFrameY*mHeight, mWidth, mHeight};
    Rectangle dest{mScreenPos.x, mScreenPos.y, mScale*mWidth, mScale*mHeight};
    DrawTexturePro(mImage, source, dest, mOrigin, mfRotation, WHITE);
Draw an mImage(texture data). with source is a rectangle we get from texture data, and write it to dest. origin is the original point that we will use to rotate the image
normally, origin(0,0) that to the top left point of destination.
We can see source with mFrameX is the Frame number in X; mFrameY is frameNumber in y
we have mScale that allow us to scale that Frame in destination rectangle
mOffsetX is an xOffset in the pixel to get the frame in the right center

Dest will be the rectangle in screen, and mOrgigin will be the position where we rotate the frame


we can see in Tick(dT), we have a concept delta time that is the time the computer used to draw the last time.
we can scale with speed(number pixels/s)
 mScreenPos = Vector2Add(mScreenPos, Vector2Scale(Vector2Normalize(mVelocity), mSpeed * aDeltaTime));

 By Sacle Velocity vector with speed * aDeltaTime we can avoid the situation where objects lag
 if CPU took time to draw a frame. I mean the time amounts for drawing frames are not the same
 If we don't use dT, and allow object to move numberofpixel(speed) each Frame we drew => sometimes a frame took more time => object moved a same distance with diffrent amount of time => lag
